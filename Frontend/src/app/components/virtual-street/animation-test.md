# Animation Synchronization Test

## Issue Fixed
When User A moves, User B sees walking animation. When User A stops, User B continues to see walking animation instead of idle animation.

## Root Cause
The `isWalking` state was only sent to the server when the player was moving (`moved = true`), but not when they stopped moving. This caused other players to never receive the "stopped walking" state.

## Solution Implemented
1. Added `previousWalkingState` tracking to detect when walking state changes
2. Send state updates when:
   - Player moves (existing behavior)
   - Walking state changes (new behavior)
3. Added proper state updates in keyup handler when player stops moving
4. Added debug logging to track state changes

## Test Steps
1. Open two browser windows/tabs with the virtual street
2. Log in as different users in each window
3. Move User A around using WASD keys
4. Observe that User B sees walking animation when User A moves
5. Stop moving User A (release all keys)
6. Verify that User B now sees idle animation for User A

## Expected Behavior
- User A moves → User B sees walking animation ✅
- User A stops → User B sees idle animation ✅
- No more animation mismatches between players

## Debug Information
Check browser console for these log messages:
- "Sending state update - Walking: true/false, Moved: true/false"
- "Sending state update on keyup - Walking: false"
- "Other player [name] walking: true/false"
